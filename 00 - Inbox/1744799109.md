GPU architecture refers to the design and organization of a Graphics Processing Unit, which is optimized for parallel computation. Unlike CPUs that focus on sequential tasks, GPUs consist of thousands of smaller cores designed to handle multiple operations simultaneously. Key components include streaming multiprocessors (SMs), memory hierarchies (global, shared, local), and specialized units for tasks like ray tracing or tensor operations.
