When a GPU kernel launches, threads are organized into thread blocks which are assigned to available Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) by the hardware scheduler. Each SM can host multiple thread blocks (occupancy), limited by its resources (registers, shared memory, warp slots). Threads execute as warps (groups of 32 threads) within SMs, with the warp scheduler selecting ready warps each cycle to hide latency.
