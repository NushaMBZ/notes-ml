Sense amplifiers are critical circuits in DRAM banks that detect and amplify the tiny voltage differences from DRAM capacitors during read operations. When a row is activated, the charge from each cell is shared with its corresponding bit line. The resulting voltage is too small to be read directly, so the sense amplifier detects the charge level and restores it to a full logic level (0 or 1).
