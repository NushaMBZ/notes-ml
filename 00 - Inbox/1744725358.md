A **linear inequality** is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using inequality symbols such as `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `≤` (less than or equal to), or `≥` (greater than or equal to), instead of an equals sign. It involves variables raised only to the first power, which makes it “linear.” For example, an inequality like `2x - 3 > 5` is a linear inequality in one variable.
