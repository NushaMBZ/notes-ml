Constant memory is a special read-only memory space on the GPU that is optimized for cases where all threads access the **same** memory location at the same time. It resides on the device but is cached, making it faster than global memory under certain access patterns. Constant memory is particularly effective when dealing with small, frequently-read datasets that don’t change during kernel execution—such as convolution kernels or lookup tables.
