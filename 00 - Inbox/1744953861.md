When threads within a warp access memory in a sequential and aligned pattern, their memory requests can be coalesced into a single memory burst. 

> [!Example] 
> For example, if thread `i` accesses address `base + i * 4`, where each access is 4 bytes, then all 32 threads in a warp collectively access a 128-byte aligned block. The GPU memory controller recognizes this pattern and issues one wide DRAM transaction instead of 32 separate ones.

This is called a coalesced access and significantly improves memory bandwidth and throughput. Misaligned or scattered accesses, by contrast, lead to multiple memory transactions and performance loss.
