Convolution is a mathematical operation that blends two functions to produce a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. In the context of image processing and signal analysis—common application domains in GPU computing—convolution is used to apply filters (kernels) to input data, often for smoothing, sharpening, edge detection, or feature extraction.

Mathematically, for a 1D discrete case, convolution is defined as:
$$
y[n]=\sum_{k=−K}^K​x[n−k]⋅h[k]
$$
Here, `x` is the input signal, `h` is the filter (or kernel), and `y` is the output signal. For 2D data, such as images, the convolution extends naturally into two dimensions:
$$
y[i,j]=\sum_{m=−M}^M\cdot\sum_{​n=−N}^N​x[i−m,j−n]⋅h[m,n]
$$
