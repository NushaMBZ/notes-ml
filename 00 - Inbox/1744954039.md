When threads in a warp access memory addresses that are not consecutive or aligned, the memory controller cannot coalesce those accesses into a single memory burst. Each distinct, non-overlapping memory location may require a separate DRAM transaction. This pattern is referred to as scattered or divergent access. It increases memory traffic and latency, leading to poor global memory performance.
